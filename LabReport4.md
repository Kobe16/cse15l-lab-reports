# CSE 15L Lab Report 4
## By: Kobe Yang

In this lab report, I will be using the command line to demostrate some different actions, such as editing with vim, running JUnit tests, and pushing changes to a Github repo. 
This lab report is based on the CSE 15L [Week 7 Website](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week7/)

Pre-Setup: 
Before touching the command line, I have forked this repo on Github: [Lab 7](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7)

1. Log into ieng6 machine. I used the bash history command to search for my previous usage of the command used to log into my ieng6 account. 

Input: 
`<ctrl> <r> <s> <enter>`

2. I clone my fork of the lab7 repo using the `git clone` command. Again, I used the bash history command to search for my previous usage of the command. That way, I wouldn't have to type out or copy/paste the Github repo URL. Note: I typed `<g>` into the search command because I know that the command starts with that letter. 

Input: 
`<ctrl> <r> <g> <enter>`

3. I run the JUnit tests to demostrate that the tests fail. First, I must move into the `lab7` directory. Then, I ran the tests using the provided bash script: `test.sh`. These commands are fast to type out, so I didn't bother using the bash history search command. Also, I made sure to use tab to autocomplete the commands. 

Input: 
`<c> <d> <space> <l> <tab> <enter> <b> <a> <s> <h> <space> <t> <tab> <enter>`
