# CSE 15L Lab Report 5
## By: Kobe Yang

In this lab report, I will be enacting a pretend conversation in an EdStem thread between a student and a TA. The student will pose a question about a bug in their code and the TA will analyze their code and attempt to debug/provide a solution. 
This lab report is based on the CSE 15L [Week 9 Website](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week9/).
