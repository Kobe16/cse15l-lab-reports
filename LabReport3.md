# CSE 15L Lab Report 3
## By: Kobe Yang

In this lab report, I will be demonstrating some different functionalities of the command `grep`. 
This lab report is based on the CSE 15L [Week 5 Website](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week5/#week5-lab-report)

## What is `grep`?

The `grep` command takes in a string and a file/file path. It will then search that file for any occurrences of that specified string and print out those lines that contain the string. 

___

## Command Line Options for `grep`
Note, for the following examples, I will be in the directory `docsearch` directory, which contains the `technical` subdirectory. 

1. `-n` option - this option prints out all lines that match the specified pattern *along with* the line numbers. This is useful because it lets you see the direct locations where the specified string appears, instead of just the lines themselves. You can now locate the occurrences of this string easily. 

Input 1: 
`grep -n "6:45" technical/911report/chapter-1.txt`

Output 1: 
```
18:    Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.
22:    Between 6:45 and 7:40, Atta and Omari, along with Satam al Suqami, Wail al Shehri, and Waleed al Shehri, checked in and boarded American Airlines Flight 11, bound for Los Angeles. The flight was scheduled to depart at 7:45.
```

Input 2: 
`grep -n "goal" technical/government/About_LSC/Comments_on_semiannual.txt`

Output 2: 
```
22:our goal of providing high quality legal assistance to the poor of
64:LSC's ultimate goal in this regard is to help grantees create
78:To further its goal of expanding recipients' use of technology,
142:LSC's primary goals for the calendar year 2002 grants
200:goal of this gathering was to address issues generated by LSC's
```

___

2. `-c` option - this option does not print out the lines that contain the specified string. Instead, it prints out the *number* of lines that contain the string. This may be useful in identifying the main idea of a file (i.e., if a certain word comes up a lot in file, then it must be important to the main idea of the file). 

Input 1: 
`grep -c "obesity" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt`

Output 1: 
```
8
```

Input 2: 
`grep -c "scientific publications" technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020001.txt`

Output 2: 
```
4
```

___

3. `-v` option - this option prints out all lines that don't contain the specified string. This may be useful in filtering out certain phrases that are needlessly repeated in the a file. It can also help you search for ideas that are not as prominent in the file. 

Input 1: 
`grep -v "Whistleblowers" technical/plos/pmed.0020281.txt`

Output 1: 
```
whistleblowing—as discussed, in part, in 
PLoS Medicine —that involves the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical
benefit management corporations, the managed care industry, and the political and lobbying
forces that zealously guard their secrets could not have been told without the help of
courageous men and women [1, 2] For that reason, those of us who congregated in Washington,
D.C., on May 15th, 2005, at the invitation and support of the Public Library of Science and
the Government Accountability Project feel particularly humbled and grateful to these two
sponsors. Our convictions could not have been aired were it not for the essential First
Amendment work of responsible journalists, who exemplify the best in investigatory
research.
For me, whistleblowing is not a theoretical exercise. It has a human face and tangible
features. It is the face of children and adults who have been injured or killed by
misrepresented pharmaceuticals; clinical research trial results that have been sequestered
from the scientific community and whose incomplete findings cause injury; and
pharmaceuticals that are detailed to physicians, not to save lives or necessarily improve
the health or welfare of the recipients, but to make money.
In the lonely and, at times, discouraging world of whistleblowing, we whistleblowers are
passionate, and often successful, because our efforts have a different goal than the
corporations and political interests whose operations we occasionally challenge. Our goal
is to tell the truth. That honest effort is the source of any ethical difference we can or
might make. Truth is the basis for the power of a whistleblower, one that can withstand the
assault of unprecedented odds against being heard put forth by that sum of political power,
expediency, and money.
A whistleblower's success depends upon competent and articulate media. The debate to
improve the status quo—be it in pharmaceutical marketing or managed-care decision
making—cannot proceed or flourish without it.
Ralph Waldo Emerson, American essayist and philosopher (1803–1882), commented about
success (I have adapted his comments for all of us who gathered in Washington in mid-May
2005): “To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a
redeemed social condition; to know even one life breathed easier because you have lived;
this is to have succeeded [as a whistleblower].”

Salt Lake City Tribune

BY EDWARD MCDONOUGH
Five independent Salt Lake organizations that provide legal
services to the poor, ethnic minorities, seniors and people with
disabilities have joined together to acquire a west-side downtown
building where they will have their offices. The new Community
All," which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising
campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal
services. "And Justice for All," which solicits donations primarily
from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising
campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the
service law groups.
last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the
agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and
client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street
from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own
parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been
a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the
building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit
agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity
Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be
efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman
desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over
town trying to find the right agency.
After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and
brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik,
own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye
explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering
what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and
brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and
old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because
the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old
Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax. The Olafsons are delighted
with the new owners. The building had been like home, she
explained, and so it was important who would be living there. I
noted on the donor list that the couple, through Olafson Group, had
become one of the major supporters of the project.
ways to go, with a bit more than half of the $4 million projected
cost received so far. There still needed to be furnishings and
office equipment and such. He promised that they would be getting
in touch with us later on the subject.
