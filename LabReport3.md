This lab report is based on the CSE 15L [Week 5 Website](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week5/#week5-lab-report)

## What is `grep`?

The `grep` command takes in a string and a file/file path. It will then search that file for any occurrences of that specified string and print out those lines that contain the string. 

## Command Line Options for `grep`
