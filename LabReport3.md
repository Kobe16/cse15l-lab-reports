# CSE 15L Lab Report 3
## By: Kobe Yang

In this lab report, I will be demonstrating some different functionalities of the command `grep`. 
This lab report is based on the CSE 15L [Week 5 Website](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week5/#week5-lab-report)

## What is `grep`?

The `grep` command takes in a string and a file/file path. It will then search that file for any occurrences of that specified string and print out those lines that contain the string. 

## Command Line Options for `grep`
Note, for the following examples, I will be in the directory `docsearch` directory, which contains the `technical` subdirectory. 

1. `-n` option - this option prints out all lines that match the specified pattern *along with* the line numbers. This is useful because it lets you see the direct locations where the specified string appears, instead of just the lines themselves. You can now locate the occurrences of this string easily. 

Input 1: 
`grep -n "6:45" technical/911report/chapter-1.txt`

Output 1: 
```
18:    Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.
22:    Between 6:45 and 7:40, Atta and Omari, along with Satam al Suqami, Wail al Shehri, and Waleed al Shehri, checked in and boarded American Airlines Flight 11, bound for Los Angeles. The flight was scheduled to depart at 7:45.
```

Input 2: 
`grep -n "goal" technical/government/About_LSC/Comments_on_semiannual.txt`

Output 2: 
```
22:our goal of providing high quality legal assistance to the poor of
64:LSC's ultimate goal in this regard is to help grantees create
78:To further its goal of expanding recipients' use of technology,
142:LSC's primary goals for the calendar year 2002 grants
200:goal of this gathering was to address issues generated by LSC's
```


2. `-c` option - this option does not print out the lines that contain the specified string. Instead, it prints out the *number* of lines that contain the string. This may be useful in identifying the main idea of a file (i.e., if a certain word comes up a lot in file, then it must be important to the main idea of the file). 

Input 1: 
`grep -c "obesity" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt`

Output 1: 
```
8
```

Input 2: 
`grep -c "scientific publications" technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020001.txt`

Output 2: 
```
4
```


4. `-w` option
5. `-A n` option
